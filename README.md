## repository for polyfills 

Polymer 3 uses Javascript modules, the polyfills of babel works well for local proyects but i need them work in codepen 8)


I try to use 

[ES Module Loader Polyfill ](https://github.com/ModuleLoader/es-module-loader)

But it did not work out of the box, so I ask in 

[polymer slack](https://polymer.slack.com)


and 
[Daniel Bus≈Çowicz](https://github.com/Draccoz)

Help me with a working example 8)

I need a copy in my own repo, so i did not link his files, so download the code and put it here.

I did not own the code, babel and others wrote it, i just have it here for my codepens to work, If some owner wants me to delete them plz notify me 8)
